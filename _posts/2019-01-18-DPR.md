A Detailed Project Report (DPR) is a comprehensive document that outlines the planning, design, and implementation of a project. It includes information on the project's goals, objectives, scope, schedule, budget, and risks. DPRs are typically used by businesses, governments, and other organizations to secure funding and approvals for major projects.

The purpose of a DPR is to provide a clear and concise roadmap for the successful completion of a project. It should be well-written, easy to understand, and comprehensive. A well-written DPR can help to ensure that a project is completed on time, on budget, and to the required quality standards.
